## Description

This is a website about the 12 labours of Hercules.
This allowed me to practice :

- The creation of a slide in CSS/JavaScript.
- The implementation of a video in a fixed position.
- The implementation of a search field with word highlighting.
(the method in JS allowing SQL injections, a Framework like JQuery is to be set up)
The use of the DOM to display the articles without router.

## Stack

- HTML
- CSS made desktop first
